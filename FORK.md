# Changes in the sebbert-custom branch

This branch of Sointu adds macOS and CLAP plugins, audio samples and buffers,
granular synthesis, spectral processing and up to 255 voices. Most of the new
synthesis features exist only in the Go synth and the WebAssembly player; the
x86 players (`vm/compiler/templates/amd64-386`) and the native bridge were left
behind on purpose. The [x86 backend](#updating-the-x86-backend) section lists
what they would need to catch up.

The rule for the synths: the Go synth and the wasm player render
**identically**, sample for sample, for everything new. Tests in
`vm/compiler/wasm_*_test.go` render songs in both (with node and wat2wasm) and
compare them. Small changes to the sound are fine, as long as both stay in
sync.

## Build and plugins

- `Makefile` builds all the tools and plugins, also in CI: `make`,
  `make install-vst`, `make install-clap`.
- A CLAP plugin (`cmd/sointu-clap`, `cmd/plugin` shared with the VST2) with 4
  note ports of 16 MIDI channels each: 64 MIDI channels.
- The plugins follow the tempo of the host, one way: the song's tempo can be
  edited, and it follows again when the host's tempo changes.
- The song is saved in the host's project. Edits mark the project unsaved
  (CLAP `mark_dirty`, VST2 `audioMasterUpdateDisplay`).
- The plugin window comes to the front when it opens.
- Vendored: Gio (`third_party/gio`, macOS plugin window and event loop fixes),
  vst2 (`third_party/vst2`, `Host.UpdateDisplay`), CLAP headers.

## Song format

All additions are optional fields, so older songs load unchanged.
Parameters added to existing unit types get values that keep old songs
sounding the same (`addedParameters` in `patch.go`).

- `Song.Buffers`: audio buffers, referenced by units through their `ID`.
  - A buffer with a `Sample` plays an imported audio file, stored in the song
    and encoded with ffmpeg for the compiled player.
  - A buffer with `Frames` is written by `bufwrite` units while the song plays.
  - A buffer with `Spectrum` holds FFT spectra. `Auto` marks buffers the
    tracker created for units and deletes with them.
- `Song.EncodingPresets`: named ffmpeg encodings that samples share.

## New units

All of these are Go and wasm only.

| Unit | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bufread` | Plays a buffer: note tracking, looping with crossfade, modulatable start/loop points, negative start counting back from the newest frame, `speed` (-1 to 1), edge fade |
| `bufwrite` | Writes into a buffer: a continuous ring buffer, or `oneshot` while the note is held. Several writers mix; `feedback`, `pop` |
| `spawn` | Triggers voices of another instrument: at a `rate`, synced to the beat, or on a rising edge. Transpose, note length, up to 4 `args`, `steal` |
| `arg` | Pushes a value passed by the `spawn` that triggered the voice |
| `window` | A smoothstep window over the spawned note, for click-free grains |
| `spfft`, `spifft`, `spcopy` | Spectral analysis and resynthesis (Hann, 4× overlap, 256 to 8192 samples, mono or stereo), copying spectra |
| `spfilter`, `spcompress`, `spblur`, `spgate`, `spphase`, `spscale`, `spformant` | Change a spectrum in place: band cut and tilt, magnitudes pulled to their mean, time smoothing and freeze, gate, phase dispersion/randomization/robot, bin scaling and shifting, formant shift |
| `spcross`, `spcomb` | Cross-synthesis/vocoder with another spectrum; resonances at the harmonics of up to 8 notes held in another instrument |

Spectral units run only in the first voice of their instrument. See the
README for the details of each unit.

## Voices

- Up to 255 voices in the Go synth and wasm player (`vm.MAX_VOICES`). Patches
  of 32 voices or fewer compile to exactly the same code as before.
- Above 32 voices (`Bytecode.WideVoices`):
  - send addresses are 3 bytes, with the global flag in bit 23 instead of 15;
  - the players use per-voice tables (`Bytecode.Polyphony`,
    `SongMacros.VoiceTracks`) instead of the polyphony and voice-track
    bitmasks;
  - the voice memory is sized by the number of voices.

## Go synth behavior changes

- `waveshape` now matches the wasm and x86 waveshapers operation by operation,
  and clips its input to [-1, 1] like them. Noise and oscillators with a shape
  other than 64, and `distort`, sound very slightly different in Go than
  before, and now identical to wasm.
- Sends to units after the 31st unit of an instrument now reach the right
  unit; before, Go decoded the unit index from 5 bits instead of 6.
- `math.Exp2` is memoized (oscillator pitch, envelope rates): same output,
  27% faster.

## Tracker

- **Buffers tab:** import samples, encoding presets and formats, preview,
  writable buffers for recording (length, clear, fit to recording), a
  waveform with the write head and where `bufread` notes play, and live
  spectra of spectrum buffers.
- **Plots:** zoom with Alt+scroll, pan by dragging or horizontal scrolling,
  Alt+drag to zoom y, double-click or right-click to reset, bounded zoom out.
- **Units:** spawn targets follow instruments when they move or are pasted;
  new spectral units pick up the spectrum above them.
- **Warnings:** spectral units in instruments with several voices, spectra
  with several writers, and buffers or spectra used across threads.
- **Other:** no notes play while typing in text fields; recordings survive
  synth rebuilds; NaNs recorded into buffers are cleared.

## Wasm player

- Samples are stored as custom sections (`sointu.buffer`). The host decodes
  them and passes them through the imported function `s.b` before
  instantiation.
- The FFT uses SIMD (f32x4), with window and twiddle tables computed at
  startup. The spectral units compute `pow`, `exp2` and `log2` in float32
  themselves (`$powf`, `$exp2f`, `$log2f`) instead of calling Math.pow.
- Template errors are no longer ignored (they used to give an empty module).

## Updating the x86 backend

What the x86 players (`vm/compiler/templates/amd64-386`) and the native bridge
(`vm/compiler/bridge`) would need to catch up. The compiler currently refuses
songs that need any of it for x86.

1. **Voice header.** The wasm voice has a 64-byte header before its units:

   | Offset | Field |
   |---|---|
   | 0 | note |
   | 4 | sustain |
   | 8 | global time + 1 when spawned |
   | 12 | release tick |
   | 16–31 | 4 spawn args |
   | 32 | spawned note length |

   Units start at +64. `spawn`, `arg`, `window` and `bufread` use these
   fields.

2. **More than 32 voices.** 3-byte send addresses with the global flag in bit
   23. Replace the polyphony and voice-track bitmasks with per-voice byte
   tables when `WideVoices`. Size the voice memory by the voice count.

3. **Buffers.** Audio loaded by the host (the native bridge has no decoder).
   The buffer header and region tables are as in `player.wat`: a header is 6
   i32s, a region 7 i32s. Implement `bufread` and `bufwrite` as in
   `vm/go_synth.go`.

4. **Spawn.** Voice allocation, the rate/sync/edge modes and the
   whole-frame countdown, as in `GoSynth.spawn`. The compiler keeps holds
   on tracks covering spawned voices (`spawnedVoices` in `patterns.go`).

5. **Spectral units.**
   - Tables are in `su_spectral`, laid out by `wasmSpectral` in
     `vm/compiler/compiler.go`: spectra, unit states, scratch, Hann window
     and twiddles.
   - The operand of each spectral unit is its index in the spectral unit
     table. `spgate`, `spphase` and `spcomb` have extra operands.
   - Stereo spectra keep their channels one after the other.
   - The float32 `log2f`, `exp2f` and `powf` must be computed operation by
     operation as in `vm/spectral.go`, or x87's 80-bit precision will make
     x86 differ. SSE would make that easy.

6. **Waveshaper.** Already matches: Go was changed to match x86 and wasm.

7. **Native bridge.** `MAX_VOICES` is 32 in the C header; `Polyphony` is a
   32-bit bitmask there.

## Known differences left

- The oscillators, envelopes and other original units still differ between
  Go and wasm by about 1e-5. Go computes some of them in float64
  (oscillator phase), and wasm imports `sin`, `pow` and `log2` from
  JavaScript. Replacing those imports with shared float32 routines, like the
  spectral units' `exp2f`, would make them identical too.
